# Be.Vlaanderen.Basisregisters.Generators.Deterministic [![Build Status](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/deterministic-guid-generator/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/deterministic-guid-generator/actions)

## Goal

Create a deterministic GUID based on a namespace, a string and an optional version.

Although a new GUID is typically created in order to provide a unique ID, there are occasions when it’s useful for two different systems to generate the same GUID independently. [RFC 4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) provides an algorithm for deterministic creation of a GUID based on a namespace ID (itself a GUID) and a name within that namespace. These name-based GUIDs will never collide with GUIDs from other sources (e.g., [Guid.NewGuid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid.newguid?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netcore-3.1#System_Guid_NewGuid)), and have a very (very) small chance of colliding with other name-based GUIDs. As per section 4.3:

* The UUIDs generated at different times from the same name in the same namespace MUST be equal.
* The UUIDs generated from two different names in the same namespace should be different (with very high probability).
* The UUIDs generated from the same name in two different namespaces should be different with (very high probability).
* If two UUIDs that were generated from names are equal, then they were generated from the same name in the same namespace (with very high probability).

Because .NET doesn’t provide a way to create these GUIDs, it’s tempting to create a custom solution (e.g., using a MD5 hash as a GUID, because it has the same number of bytes), but because that doesn’t follow the rules of GUID creation, it’s not guaranteed to be unique with respect to other GUIDs.

## Usage

Determine a namespace for your use case, this is just a random GUID you can store somewhere.

Using `Deterministic.Create` you can now pass in the namespace and a value and it will always return the same GUID.

By default a version 5 GUID is created.

```csharp
var namespaceGuid = new Guid("6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8");
var value = "hello.example.com";
var deterministicGuid = Deterministic.Create(namespaceGuid, value);
```

A version 3 GUID uses MD5 to compute a hash of the namespace and name.

```csharp
var namespaceGuid = new Guid("6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8");
var value = "hello.example.com";
var version = 5;
var deterministicGuid = Deterministic.Create(namespaceGuid, value, version);
```

A version 5 GUID uses SHA1 to compute a hash of the namespace and name.

```csharp
var namespaceGuid = new Guid("6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8");
var value = "hello.example.com";
var version = 5;
var deterministicGuid = Deterministic.Create(namespaceGuid, value, version);
```
